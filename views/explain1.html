            Thank you for participating our research project on <span class="emphasize">code changes</span>.<br>
            In this project, we are investigating how code changes can be explained with primitive edit operations.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Once you start, you're given <span class="emphasize">five</span> code changes obtained from open source projects.<br>
            Each code change consists of two versions of source code.<br>
            Your task is generating an <span class="emphasize">edit script</span>-a series of edit operations- by selecting changed parts of the code.<br>
            <br>
        </div>
        <!-- <div class="image_container">

        <div class="contents">
            <br>
            There are four primitive edit operations you can use to describe a code change: <span class="emphasize">insert</span>, <span class="emphasize">delete</span>, <span class="emphasize">move</span> and <span class="emphasize">update</span>.<br>
            We will go through each edit operation with an example, and let you know how to generate the operations.<br>
